# Real-Time Speech to Sign Language Conversion System

## Overview
This AI-powered system provides real-time conversion of spoken language into sign language through animated avatars. It is designed to ensure effective communication and inclusivity for individuals with hearing and speech impairments during government functions, public events, and everyday situations. The solution eliminates the dependency on sign language experts and ensures accessible and accurate communication.

## Features
- **Real-Time Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken language to text using advanced speech recognition algorithms.
- **Sign Language Translation**: Translates text into sign language using animated avatars.
- **Animated Avatars**: Display sign language gestures in real-time for easy understanding.
- **Inclusivity**: Provides a seamless communication method for individuals with hearing and speech impairments.
- **AI-Driven**: Utilizes artificial intelligence for accurate and context-aware translations.
  
## Purpose
The main goal of this project is to break communication barriers by providing a system that facilitates real-time speech-to-sign language conversion, especially during public events and official functions, where sign language experts may not be readily available. This solution is designed to foster inclusivity and equal access to information.

## How It Works
1. **Speech Input**: The system listens to the spoken language in real-time using a microphone.
2. **Speech-to-Text**: The system converts speech into text using a speech recognition model.
3. **Text-to-Sign Language**: The converted text is then processed and translated into corresponding sign language gestures by the AI model.
4. **Avatar Display**: The animated avatar performs the sign language gestures corresponding to the text.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, Flask/Django (depending on your backend choice)
- **AI & Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch (for training models on speech recognition and sign language translation)
- **Speech Recognition**: Google Speech API, Mozilla DeepSpeech, or a similar service
- **Avatar Animation**: Three.js, Unity, or Blender for animated avatars

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Praveenku-mar/Speech_to_Indian_Sigh_Language_Conversion.git
   cd repository-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
Once the system is running, simply speak into the microphone, and the system will automatically convert your speech to sign language using animated avatars. The application is designed to function in real-time, providing a smooth user experience.
